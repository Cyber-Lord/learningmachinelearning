# Learning Machine Learning

## Start here

1. Intro to ML: ML Zero to Hero (Part 1) - https://bit.ly/lml-001
2. Basic Computer Vision: ML Zero to Hero (Part 2) - https://bit.ly/lml-002 (If you watched Part 1 & didn't go on to watch Part 2, this learning machine learning thing may be a bit hectic for you. For every resource I link to, please follow that resource down the rabbit hole i.e. links to related articles, playlists that a video belongs to, suggestions & recommendations etc.)
3. Search on Google (or your preferred search engine) for "machine learning" - https://www.google.com/search?q=machine+learning&oq=machine+learning (I always do this when learning something knew or whenever I run in to a bug, error message etc. Read at least the top non-ad post.)
4. Read (or study) the Wikipedia entry for machine learning - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning (Don't forget to go down the rabbit hole as much as you can).
5. Introducing convolutional neural networks: ML Zero to Hero (Part 3) - https://bit.ly/lml-003 (Down the rabbit hole, at least watch Part 4 of this series)
