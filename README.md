# Learning Machine Learning

## Start here

1. Intro to ML: ML Zero to Hero (Part 1) - https://bit.ly/lml-001
2. Basic Computer Vision: ML Zero to Hero (Part 2) - https://bit.ly/lml-002 (If you watched Part 1 & didn't go on to watch Part 2, this learning machine learning thing may be a bit hectic for you. For every resource I link to, please follow that resource down the rabbit hole i.e. links to related articles, playlists that a video belongs to, suggestions & recommendations etc.)
3. Search on Google (or your preferred search engine) for "machine learning" - https://www.google.com/search?q=machine+learning&oq=machine+learning (I always do this when learning something knew or whenever I run in to a bug, error message etc. Read at least the top non-ad post.)
4. Read (or study) the Wikipedia entry for machine learning - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning (Don't forget to go down the rabbit hole as much as you can).
5. Introducing convolutional neural networks: ML Zero to Hero (Part 3) - https://bit.ly/lml-003 (Down the rabbit hole, at least watch Part 4 - https://bit.ly/lml-004x - of this series) 
6. Learn Python, the most important language for data science & machine learning - https://bit.ly/lml-005 (I prefer Kaggle's introductory courses but the official Python Tutorial, Datacamp, Pluralsight, Udacity, Udemy and a host of others are all excellent resources). So "Why Kaggle? And what is Kaggle?" Yourpreferred search engine and Wikipedia to the rescue!
7. TF 2.x on Kaggle (TF Dev Summit '20) - https://bit.ly/lml-006. For some inspiration (& perspiration) from [TF Dev Summit 2020](https://www.tensorflow.org/dev-summit), go further down the rabbit hole and at least watch the keynote on this playlist - https://bit.ly/lml-007
